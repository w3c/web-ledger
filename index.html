This document outlines a data model and syntax for expressing a
set of ordered events in a decentralized system in way that can be
cryptographically verified. This technology is useful when coordinating
the recording of events, such as financial transactions, transfer of property,
or time-stamped data that must be shared among coordinating parties. A
primary goal of this ledger format is flexibility, allowing the
pluggability of consensus algorithms, data structures for recording
history, and the type of data that can be stored in the ledger. The format and
protocol described in this document can be used by existing systems
(e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) to expose their data and functionality in an
interoperable fashion.

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
Decentralized systems often need to coordinate information on their
operational state. While the entire state of the system doesn't need to be
shared, the parts that affect the operation of the entire system are important.
At their most basic, a <a>decentralized system</a> can be viewed as a
<a>state machine</a> where events modify the state of the machine
resulting in a new state:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="diagrams/ds-lifetime.svg" />
    <figcaption>
A decentralized system can be viewed as a state machine where events
transition the machine from one state to the next.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
There may be many different types of events in the system. Some events may
handle system configuration, defining what the system is and isn't allowed
to do. Some events may store data in the system that must be accessible by
the entire system while other events snapshot the state of the system
for performance and auditing purposes. Other events record the consensus of
the system as a whole at a given point in time so that participants in the
system can know that other participants agree with their view of the system.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="diagrams/ledger-events.svg" />
    <figcaption>
There may be many different types of events that trigger state changes in
a decentralized system.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
Each event may affect the global system state in some way. This means that
the current state is a representation of all the states and events that came
before it.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="diagrams/system-state.svg" />
    <figcaption>
As the system processes each type of event, its underlying state changes.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
It is typically important to optimize the storage of the events and
package these events into a data structure called a <a>block</a>. These
<a>blocks</a> are then "chained" together into a system that is often
referred to as a <a>blockchain</a>.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="diagrams/blockchain.svg" />
    <figcaption>
Events are typically packaged into blocks for the purposes of storage
efficiency.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
In certain decentralized systems, like financial or healthcare systems,
auditing these states and events is important to ensure that they are
operating in an acceptable way from a regulatory perspective.
Thus a verifiable record of these events and states is an important component
of the system design, but has not been a practical endeavor until recently.
  </p>
  <p>
Due to recent advances in cryptography and decentralized systems design a new
set of technologies called <a>cryptographic ledgers</a>
(aka <a>blockchains</a>) have enabled the
recording of state and events in a ledger where the ledger can be distributed
and independently verified using cryptography. Some of these ledger systems are
<em>trustless</em>, meaning that no trust (other than a trust in mathematics) is
necessary in order to participate in the system. Other ledger systems are
<em>permissioned</em>, meaning that some trust in third parties is required to
ensure the accuracy of the ledger.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="diagrams/basic-ledger.svg" />
    <figcaption>
A cryptographic ledger is a log of states and events that can be independently
verified using cryptography.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
This specification details an extensible data model and syntax for expressing
cryptographic ledgers. The data model in this specification is designed to
be protocol-agnostic and flexible, supporting pluggability of consensus
algorithms, various data structures for recording history, and enabling a
wide range of data types to be stored in the ledger.

  </dd>

<section>
  <h2>Data Model</h2>

  <p>
To provide the greatest amount of flexibility, the data model is a graph.
If a formalized data model is desired, RDF may be utilized but is not necessary.
  </p>

  <p>
To ensure that the syntax will be easily adopted by developers, and supports
a graph-based data model, it is RECOMMENDED that the implementation syntax is
JSON-LD (or similarly compatible syntax). Other RDF-compatible syntaxes MAY
also be used to express the ledger semantics. This ensures that the syntax is
processable by widely adopted JSON tooling while also ensuring that the
data model is robust enough to handle decentralized extensibility without
name clashes or conflicts.
  </p>

  <p>
A ledger consists of a series of entries. This section outlines the basic
types of entries that all Web Ledgers support. A particular Web Ledger MAY
contain more than these basic entries.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h3>Blocks</h3>

    <p>
A <a>block</a> contains one or more changes to the <a>state machine</a>.
Blocks are typically used as a storage optimization to bundle a set of
changes to the <a>state machine</a>. There can be many types of blocks.
This specification details the basic set of blocks that all Web Ledgers
may express.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Configuration Block</h3>

    <p>
A configuration block specifies which software algorithms should be applied
when processing a particular Web Ledger. The first entry in a Ledger is
typically an entry called a <a>genesis block</a>. The genesis block has the
following basic layout:
    </p>

    <pre class="example highlight" title="Example genesis block">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/web-ledger/v1",
  "id": BLOCK_ID,
  "type": "LedgerConfigurationBlock",
  "ledgerConfig": {
    "id": LEDGER_ID,
    "type": "LedgerConfiguration",
    "name": "example",
    "description": "This is an example ledger.",
    "storageMechanism": STORAGE_DATA_STRUCTURE,
    "consensusAlgorithm": CONSENSUS_ALGORITHM,
  "previousBlock": {
    "hash": "urn:sha256:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  },
  "signature": SIGNATURE_VALUE
}
    </pre>

    <p>
In the example above, <code>LEDGER_ID</code> is used to uniquely identify the
ledger (e.g. <code>did:f6ea280f-8011-4502-a29f-464954de3427</code>).
<code>BLOCK_ID</code> is used to uniquely identify the <a>block</a> in the ledger
(e.g. <code>did:f6ea280f-8011-4502-a29f-464954de3427/blocks/1</code>.
<code>STORAGE_DATA_STRUCTURE</code> is used to identify the storage mechanism
that is used in the ledger (e.g. <code>SequentialList</code>) so that
serializing and
deserializing the contents of the ledger remains consistent across ledgers.
<code>SIGNATURE_VALUE</code> is used to perform the cryptographic proof that
the ledger block was created by the entity identified in the signature. A more
complete <a href="#example-genesis-block">example of a genesis block</a> is
available in the appendix.
    </p>

    <p>
A standard configuration block update only differs from a genesis block in
that the <code>previousBlock</code> value refers to the block before the
current block:
    </p>

    <pre class="example highlight" title="Example configuration block update">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/web-ledger/v1",
  "id": BLOCK_ID,
  "type": "LedgerConfigurationBlock",
  "ledgerConfig": {
    "id": LEDGER_ID,
    "type": "LedgerConfiguration",
    "name": "example",
    "description": "This is an example ledger.",
    "storageMechanism": STORAGE_DATA_STRUCTURE,
    "consensusAlgorithm": CONSENSUS_ALGORITHM,
  "previousBlock": {
    "id": PREVIOUS_BLOCK_ID,
    "hash": PREVIOUS_BLOCK_HASH
  },
  "signature": SIGNATURE_VALUE
}
    </pre>

    <p>
The  <code>PREVIOUS_BLOCK_ID</code> is the identifier of the previous
block in the ledger (e.g.
<code>did:f6ea280f-8011-4502-a29f-464954de3427/blocks/1</code>) and the
<code>PREVIOUS_BLOCK_HASH</code> value (e.g.
<code>urn:sha256:abd465d34f7a3f0f7d849550eb9fc32c17d12881da6b524da0a96e12cc984538</code>
is a hash of the previous block in the ledger.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Storage Block</h3>

    <p>
A storage block stores data in a ledger and has the following general layout:
    </p>

    <pre class="example highlight" title="Example storage event entry">
{
  "@context": ["https://w3id.org/web-ledger/v1", MARKET_VERTICAL_CONTEXT],
  "id": BLOCK_ID,
  "type": "LedgerStorageBlock",
  "setObject": [ OBJECTS ],
  "previousBlock": {
    "id": PREVIOUS_BLOCK_ID
    "hash": PREVIOUS_BLOCK_HASH
  },
  "signature": SIGNATURE_VALUE
}
    </pre>

    <p>
When storing data in the ledger, one may use a
<code>MARKET_VERTICAL_CONTEXT</code> to add semantics to the objects stored in
<code>OBJECTS</code>
(e.g. <code>https://w3id.org/vaccinations/v1</code>).
<code>OBJECTS</code> are one or more JSON objects that can be stored in
the ledger. It is expected that each object has a unique identifier to
enable searching based on that identifier. A detailed
<a href="example-storage-block">example of a storage event</a> is included in
the appendix.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Consensus Block</h3>

    <p class="issue" title="Consensus feature is highly experimental">
It's currently not specified in a configuration event how often consensus
events should occur. The options are: per event, or every N events. This is
an active area of research and debate.
    </p>

    <p>
A consensus event is an assertion that there is agreement on a subset of entries
in a ledger. Some ledgers do not require consensus events as each event
establishes an acceptable level of consensus. Other ledgers require consensus
events after a pre-determined amount of time. An example of the basic layout
of a consensus event is shown below:
    </p>

    <pre class="example highlight" title="Example storage event entry">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/web-ledger/v1",
  "id": BLOCK_ID,
  "type": "ConsensusBlock",
  "previousBlock": {
    "id": PREVIOUS_BLOCK_ID
    "hash": PREVIOUS_BLOCK_HASH
  },
  "signature": [ SIGNATURES ]
}
    </pre>

    <p>
A consensus event has a relatively simple definition. It consists of a
number of <code>SIGNATURES</code> from notaries as determined by the previous
configuration event. A more complete
<a href="#example-consensus-block">example of a consensus event</a>
is located in the appendix.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Checkpoint Block</h3>

    <p>
A checkpoint event may be used to quickly bootstrap new mirrors for a ledger.
An example of the basic layout of a checkpoint event is shown below:
    </p>

    <pre class="example highlight" title="Example checkpoint event">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/web-ledger/v1",
  "id": BLOCK_ID,
  "type": "LedgerCheckpointBlock",
  "checkpointLog": CHECKPOINT_LOG_URL,
  "checkpointLogHash": CHECKPOINT_LOG_HASH,
  "signature": [ SIGNATURES ]
}
    </pre>

    <p>
A checkpoint event declares a <code>CHECKPOINT_LOG_URL</code>
(e.g. <code>https://example.org/ledgers/example/checkpoints/132</code>) and a
<code>CHECKPOINT_LOG_HASH</code>
(e.g. <code>urn:sha256:7fa3b9eaa8d92d2b87abf83d88a92ff23</code>).
All notaries typically download the checkpoint log and
check it before providing signatures noting that the checkpoint log is valid.
There is a detailed
<a href="#example-checkpoint-block">example of a checkpoint event</a>
in the appendix.
    </p>

    <p class="issue" title="Checkpointing feature is highly experimental">
How checkpoints are generated are a current topic of debate. The configuration
event doesn't specify how often checkpoints can/should happen. It is also
debatable that a checkpoint should be included in a consensus event and
shouldn't be a separate event.
    </p>

  </section>

<section>
  <h2>HTTP API</h2>

  <p>
The previous section defined the data model and messages that can be used
to create and operate a ledger. This section provides the HTTP API endpoints
that may be used in conjunction with the messages in the previous section to
create and operate a ledger.
  </p>

  <p class="issue" title="The HTTP API is a Work in Progress">
Note that the API proposed here only has one implementation and, while designed
to be flexible, does not have enough deployment experience to be used in
production systems that require strong interoperability guarantees. This is
a work in progress.
  </p>

  <table class="simple">
    <thead>
      <th>Service</th>
      <th>Example URL</th>

    <h3>Discovering Service Endpoints</h3>

    <p>
A website may provide service endpoint discover by embedding JSON-LD in their
top-most HTML web page (e.g. at <code>https://example.com/</code>):
    </p>

    <pre class="example highlight" title="Example of HTML-based service description">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html lang="en">
  &lt;head>
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8">

}
    &lt;/script>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;!-- page content -->
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
    </pre>

    <p>
Service descriptions may also be requested via content negotiation.
In the following example a JSON-compatible service description is provided
(e.g. <code>curl -H "Accept: application/json" https://example.com/</code>):
    </p>

    <pre class="example highlight" title="Example of a JSON-based service description">

}
    </pre>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Create Service</h3>

    <p>
A ledger is created by performing an HTTP POST of a
<a href="#configuration-block">LedgerConfigurationEvent</a>
to the <code>ledgerCreateService</code>. The following HTTP status codes
are defined for this service:
    </p>

    <table class="simple">
      <thead>
        <th style="white-space: nowrap">HTTP Status</th>
        <th>Description</th>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>201</td>
          <td>
Ledger creation was successful. The HTTP <code>Location</code> header will
contain the URL for the newly created ledger.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>400</td>
          <td>Ledger creation failed.</td>
